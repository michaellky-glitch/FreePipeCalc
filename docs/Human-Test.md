# Human test log

What has actually been checked by a person, and what has not.

This is deliberately separate from the automated suites. Those cover 746
assertions of engine behaviour (all passing), but they
cannot tell you whether a button is
discoverable, whether a drawing prints legibly, or whether a result *looks*
right to someone who sizes pipes for a living. Only Michael can sign those off.

**Status key** — ✅ passed · ⚠️ passed with a note · ❌ failed · ⬜ not tested yet

Last updated: 2026-08-02 (v0.7.8-dev)

## Awaiting Michael's eye — new in v0.7.0-dev

Same caveat as below: built and internally verified, but the build
environment's browser has a 0×0 viewport, so **no pixels were ever rendered**
and nothing here has been looked at.

| # | What | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8.1 | Undo removes a pump/equipment in ONE press | ❌ | Intermetent bug. Sometimes works. Log as unsolved but low priority. |
| 8.9 | Globe valve: symbol, and Kv about 6× lower than a gate | ⬜ | Filled disc at the throat. 7 assertions. |
| 8.10 | Check valve flapper symbol | ⬜ | Per Michael's screen snip; was a bowtie. |
| 8.13 | Dragging a node onto another joins them; straight run goes continuous | ⬜ | Refuses to dissolve a size change, a corner, or a node with a device. |
| 8.16 | Check valve symbol is larger and its direction readable | ⬜ | **Michael reported this.** 1.6× the bowtie valves. |
| 8.18 | Pipe properties show Pressure drop and PD/m | ⬜ | Verified against the engine (5.69 kPa, 699.8 Pa/m). Note they are on different lengths and say so. |
| 8.19 | ANNOTATIONS: "Node" group, with a Pressure toggle | ⚠️ | Show -ve pressure in red. |
| 8.20 | Visualisers: FLOW, VELOCITY, PRESSURE | ⚠️ | Gradient pressure between 2 nodes on pipe. |

## Awaiting Michael's eye — new in v0.6.0-dev

Built and internally verified (logic node-tested, behaviour driven through the
live DOM), but **nothing below has been looked at by a person**. The preview
browser in the build environment has a 0×0 viewport, so no pixels were ever
rendered — anything about how these LOOK is unverified.

| # | What | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | Riser select handle (triangle) + riser size/schedule/C | ⚠️ | Change the riser location marker to be from lower left (225 degrees). Arrow should point up or down to show flow direction. |
| 7.2 | New riser runs to the View Direction level automatically | ⚠️ | New riser from node to pipe is not connecting. Mid-pipe to node works. |
| 7.4 | Devices drawn as point symbols on a thin connector | ⚠️ | **The one to judge.** Agreed in principle only. At high zoom a 0.7 m pump link is still 0.7 m of drawing with a fixed-size symbol on it. M: Acceptable but if possible make pump 0.5m to match grids.|
| 7.6 | Multi-select → bulk size / schedule / C | ⚠️ | Blank = leave alone. Verified bores follow. |

## 1. Calculations

Nothing here has been signed off yet. The numbers reconcile internally and
against hand calculations, but no independent check against another tool or a
known project has been done.

| # | What | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | 3-floor riser + ring main solves sensibly | ⚠️ | Built and reviewed; energy balance closes exactly. Not checked against another tool. |
| 1.2 | Data centre closed circuit, redundant pumps | ⚠️ | Runs; equipment gets exactly its rated flow and ΔP. Numbers not independently verified. |
| 1.11 | `...ring_main.pnet (fixed).json` redrawn example | ⚠️ | **Rebuilt by hand 2026-07-30 and now coherent** — devices are short links (pumps 0.7 m, equip 0.49 m), ~377 m of real pipe carries friction, solves cleanly as a 20 L/s circuit. Numbers not yet independently verified against another tool. |
| 1.3 | Hazen-Williams against a manual calculation | ⚠️ | **Constants independently confirmed 2026-07-31**: ASHRAE Eq (6), Δh = 6.819·L·(V/C)^1.852·(1/D)^1.167, reduces algebraically to the app's A = 10.67 and e = 4.8704 (agreement 0.035% and 0.012%). ASHRAE Example 1 also reproduces exactly (750.0 Pa). A full worked pipe run by hand is still outstanding. |
| 1.10 | Hazen-Williams, converging/diverging tees | ❌ | **Michael found this wrong.** Two causes, both confirmed in code — see `ENGINE.md`. Blocked on choosing a coefficient source. |
| 1.5 | Loop flow split against hand calculation | ⬜ | Rings balance to ~1e-16 internally; not checked externally. |
| 1.6 | Pump duty vs. a real selection | ⬜ | |
| 1.7 | Darcy-Weisbach | ❌ | **Blocked** — friction-factor correlation not chosen yet. Do not issue calculations from this method. |
| 1.8 | Critical path is the genuinely worst circuit | ⬜ | Picks the smallest-residual terminal. Worth checking against judgement on a real job. |

## 2. Drawing

| # | What | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.4 | Snap priority node > pipe > grid | ⬜ | Rewritten so the grid constrains length along the ray. Needs a human eye. |
| 2.5 | Riser placement and cross-level connection | ⚠️ | Michael reported it was still being checked. Alignment logic reworked since. |
| 2.6 | Levels: add, remove, reorder by drag, `[E]` editor | ⬜ | |

## 3. Devices

| # | What | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.2 | Pump insert, auto / fixed / off | ⚠️ | Auto-sizing reworked twice. Re-check duty figures. |
| 3.6 | Pump curve: from duty, paste, table | ⬜ | **New.** Driven in-browser during the redundancy battery; not used by hand. |

## 4. Interface

| # | What | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.4 | Vertical pipe label drag box | ⚠️ | Was a horizontal box on a vertical pipe (Michael's screenshot). Fixed; needs confirming. |
| 4.7 | Custom pipe schedule: paste from a spreadsheet | ⬜ | **New.** Three columns, all in mm. |
| 4.9 | Dark and light themes | ⚠️ | Light theme outside drawing area can be a bit grey. |
| 4.10 | Every checkbox is now a switch | ⬜ | **New in v0.7.7-dev.** Panels, the annotations list, and HYDRAULIC. Verified in the DOM (no `input[type=checkbox]` left in any panel) and each one toggles the model. Two things to look at: does a column of switches read better than tick boxes at this density, and is the muted-vs-accent off/on state clear enough? It is deliberately NOT red/green — red is a fault everywhere else in this app. |
| 4.11 | PRESSURE visualiser gradients along a pipe | ⬜ | **New in v0.7.7-dev.** Verified through the real render path: a plain pipe ramps between its two node colours, a pump/valve/equipment link gets a hard step at the symbol. Never seen as pixels — the legend, the disc-over-gradient contrast and whether the ramp is legible at working zoom are all yours. |
| 4.12 | K factor on outflows, pumps and equipment | ⬜ | **New in v0.7.7-dev.** From the design values, in the model's display units, unit spelled out (`0.316 L/s/√kPa`). Hover gives the arithmetic and warns it is neither the sprinkler K nor a Kv. |
| 4.13 | PROBE under VIEW | ⬜ | **New in v0.7.8-dev.** Verified through real pointer events: hover follows the pipe, click pins, Esc clears the pin (a second Esc leaves the tool). The readout box, the crosshair marker and whether a 24 px catch radius feels right are all yours. |

## 4A. TRACE mode

New in v0.5.0. Internally tested (paste, render, calibration, drag, scale, lock,
grid suppression, save/load and the autosave fallback all verified in-browser),
but nothing here has been used against a real drawing yet.

| # | What | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4A.1 | Ctrl+V a real screen snip from a PDF | ⬜ | Synthetic images only so far. |
| 4A.2 | Drag-and-drop an image file | ⬜ | |
| 4A.3 | Paste works from `file://` | ⬜ | **Most important item here.** The paste event should not be blocked from disk, but it has only been proven over HTTP. |
| 4A.4 | Two-point scale calibration on a real drawing | ⬜ | Verified numerically; needs a drawing with a known dimension. |
| 4A.5 | Legibility over a white PDF background | ⬜ | Invert + 0.6 opacity is the default on the dark theme. Judgement call. |
| 4A.6 | Trace, then check lengths against the real drawing | ⬜ | The whole point of workflow 1. |
| 4A.7 | Multi-level: a different drawing per floor | ⬜ | |
| 4A.8 | Model file size with 3+ traces | ⬜ | ~50 KB each in testing. |

## 4B. DESIGN / SIMULATION modes

New in v0.5.0. The redundancy battery below was run in Node and reproduced
in-browser; the numbers were checked against hand calculations of the parallel
pump curves, not read back out of the code.

**Battery: `datacentre-ring`, pump selected at +10% on both flow and head.**

| Step | Result | Sensible? |
|---|---|---|
| 1 pump, curve at 22.0 L/s @ 285.6 kPa | 21.25 L/s @ 292.1 kPa; CRAH-01 takes 21.24 L/s (106% of design) | Yes — an oversized pump rides out along its curve until the system absorbs it |
| 4 pumps, each 5.5 L/s @ 285.6 kPa | 21.66 L/s total, 5.40–5.43 L/s each @ ~288.5 kPa | Yes — matches `H₀ − a(Q/4)²` by hand to 0.1%; identical pumps share within 0.6% |
| 1 of 4 fails | 19.82 L/s total, 6.60 L/s each @ 243.5 kPa, survivors at 120% of design | Yes — losing 25% of the pumps loses only 8.5% of the flow, and the survivors ride out |

The last row is the point of the feature: flow barely moves, but each surviving
pump is pushed to 120% of its selection, which is where motor loading and NPSH
need checking. That now raises a `PUMP_RUNOUT` warning against an editable
threshold (`settings.warn.pumpRunout`, default 120%).

| # | What | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4B.1 | DESIGN/SIMULATION chip toggles and locks the calculated side | ⚠️ | Reworked in v0.7.6-dev — see 4B.6–4B.11. Nothing is a disabled input any more; both sides are read-only boxes. Needs a human eye on discoverability. |
| 4B.3 | Parallel pumps and N+1 failure | ⚠️ | Battery above. Not checked against another tool. |
| 4B.4 | Balancing Kv figures | ⬜ | Computed but never checked against a valve schedule. |
| 4B.5 | Fitted curve from a real manufacturer datasheet | ⬜ | **Most important item here.** Only synthetic curves so far. |
| 4B.6 | Pump panel: order reads Pump ID / Tag / Direction / Status / DESIGN / ACTUAL | ⬜ | **New in v0.7.6-dev.** Verified in the DOM; never rendered to pixels. |
| 4B.7 | The 🛈 marker beside the pump heading | ⬜ | **New.** Hover text confirmed present. Two things to look at: does the glyph render on your machine (it may fall back to a box), and is a hover tooltip discoverable enough for what it says? |
| 4B.8 | "New curve…" jumps to TOOLS with the duty pre-filled | ⬜ | **New.** Verified in the DOM: the tab switches and the generator opens carrying the pump's design flow and pressure. |
| 4B.9 | DESIGN vs ACTUAL boxes are visually distinguishable | ⬜ | **New.** Two `.readout` boxes with small caps titles. Purely a look question. |
| 4B.10 | Outflow in SIMULATE: design box editable, actual box beside it | ⬜ | **New in v0.7.6-dev.** The design flow is now EDITABLE in SIMULATE (it is the input the terminal's characteristic comes from, not a result). Worth confirming that reads right. |
| 4B.11 | Head is no longer a settable pump parameter | ⬜ | **New.** The box was permanently disabled and is gone. Confirm nothing is missed by its absence. |

## 4C. TOOLS tab

| # | What | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4C.2 | Copy 3 points → paste into a pump | ⚠️ | Verified in-browser; the three stated duties come back exact. Not yet done by hand through the clipboard. |
| 4C.3 | Copy full table → paste into a pump | ⚠️ | Works, but shifts all three stated duties ~1%. The tool says so. |
| 4C.4 | Clipboard copy over `file://` | ⬜ | Uses the `execCommand` fallback, same as the rest of the app. Proven over HTTP only. |
| 4C.5 | Rising / concave-up curve warnings | ⬜ | Unit-tested; not seen by a human. |

## 5. Output

| # | What | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | Calculation sheet readability | ⬜ | |
| 5.2 | Critical path listed first and highlighted | ⬜ | **New.** |
| 5.3 | CSV export opens cleanly in Excel | ⬜ | Check the delimiter/decimal option for your locale. |
| 5.4 | Print calculation sheet | ⬜ | Letterhead margin reserved at the top. |
| 5.5 | Print level plans — one page per level, shared scale | ⬜ | Sheets should physically overlay. |
| 5.6 | Save and reload a model | ⚠️ | Exercised constantly in testing; not deliberately stress-tested. |

## 6. Error handling

| # | What | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | No source → "Water source is required" | ⬜ | |
| 6.2 | Supply insufficient → red source, actual flows in brackets | ⬜ | |
| 6.3 | Dead-ended pump | ⬜ | |
| 6.5 | Laminar flow warning | ⬜ | |
| 6.6 | Shut valve starving a demand | ⬜ | |

## 6A. Source pressure and pipe length (v0.7.7-dev)

Both of these came from `debug/20260802-1.json` and are reproduced in the
automated suites, but the *reading* is the part only you can sign off.

| # | What | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6A.1 | A source node reads its stated pressure | ⬜ | Was 0 kPa gauge, which read as a jump at the next node. Now `H = z + P/(ρg)`, so the node reads exactly what is typed into it. **Every downstream number is unchanged** — check that against a model you already know. |
| 6A.2 | Setting a source pressure no longer moves the node | ⬜ | It was stored as an elevation. `20260802-1.json` now loads with its pipe at exactly 50 m, not 54.01 m. |
| 6A.3 | Pipe length is editable on a sloped pipe | ⬜ | `changeLength` was comparing a 3D length to a plan length. It now solves `plan = √(L² − rise²)` and refuses a length below the rise. |
| 6A.4 | The migration dialog on loading an older file | ⬜ | **Please read it and say whether it explains itself.** It fires once per file and it is telling you pipe lengths have changed. |
| 6A.5 | Sloped layout pipes are refused | ⬜ | **New in v0.7.8-dev.** A pipe whose ends differ in elevation is a `SLOPED_PIPE` error and takes the status chip red. Verified in-browser on the old `20260802-1.json` geometry. Worth checking against any model of yours that predates the rule — if one lights up, the pipe was being measured along its slope and its friction was overstated. |
| 6A.6 | Pipe lengths after the rule change | ⬜ | **Please spot-check a model you know.** Any pipe whose ends were at the same elevation is unchanged to the last decimal. Only a pipe that was silently sloped moves — and that one was wrong before. |

## Known gaps

* **Darcy-Weisbach is unusable** until the friction-factor correlation is
  chosen. Four are implemented; the spread is ≤1.4%, so it is a judgement call
  about auditability rather than accuracy.
* **No independent verification of any result.** Everything so far is internal
  consistency plus hand calculations by the author of the code, which is the
  weakest form of check. A comparison against another tool, or against a job
  with known answers, is the single most valuable thing left to do.
* **Light theme** has barely been looked at — including how a trace looks on it,
  where invert defaults to off.
* **TRACE has never seen a real drawing.** Everything so far is synthetic line
  art generated in the test itself.
* **Printing** has not been done on real paper.
* **Simulated outflow flow is now proven, in algebra.** `Q = Q_d·√(P_node/ΔP_d)`
  holds to 1e-9 in `simulation.test.js` and was re-confirmed live in the browser
  (18.78 L/s at 176.4 kPa against a hand answer of 18.78 L/s). That verifies the
  *relationship*; it does not verify that the absolute numbers match another
  tool, which remains the gap above.
* **No pump curve has ever been fitted from a real datasheet.** The fitter is
  exercised only against curves generated from its own form, which it recovers
  exactly — that proves the algebra, not that manufacturer curves take this
  shape. The fit quality is displayed for precisely this reason.

## How to log a result

Set the status, add a note if it is anything other than a clean pass, and update
the date at the top. If something fails, a line about *what you did* and *what
you expected* is worth more than the failure itself.
